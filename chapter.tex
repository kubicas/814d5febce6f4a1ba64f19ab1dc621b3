\section*{Function description}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Within the research project 'Flying Start' the last major hurdle is the
expression of make/build relations in the native language, being C++. Currently,
OS specific scripts are used for building software and documentation, and it is
desired to replace this by a pure C++ solution (no make, cmake, etc.) 
Overcoming this hurdle enables true multiplatform support.
This challenging cppmake sub-project includes:

\begin{itemize}
\item Scrum based way-of-working (sprint duration = 1 week)
\item Algorithm based on dependency graphs
\item Make-status data storage and retreival
\item Platform independence
\item IDE independence, compiler independence
\item Integration with git
\item Using (a subset of) UML
\end{itemize}
